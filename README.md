# Airbnb-under-COVID-19

In this project, we are exploring the data of Inside Airbnb, an independent project that collects and hosts Airbnb data on 100 or more cities around the world. Thankfully, Inside Airbnb made their data public so we can explore their data freely. What we are using is the Airbnb data from San Francisco collected in June 2020 and 2019. We are comparing two datasets in different year in order to see how much COVID-19 affected Airbnb in San Francisco. From the given datasets, we will be using ‘calendar_2019’ and ‘calender_2020’. Looking at our dataset ‘calendar’, this dataset consists of features, ‘listing_id’, ‘date’, ‘price’, and ‘available’. The ‘listing_id’ is used to distinguish the data points, ‘date’ gives the potential availability in question, ‘price’ gives price per night of listing in USD, and finally ‘available’ gives true or false value representing whether the listing was available. After reviewing our datasets’ features, we decided to focus on ‘listing_id’ and ‘available’ in order to check the availability before after COVID-19 occured. These variables will be the most important feature to our analysis since it directly shows whether availability changed between two years by true and false. We can count the number of true and false, draw a distribution chart, and get percentage chart in order to see the analysis this question in multiple views.
